# React101

Tiny React app scaffolded with Vite. This repo is intended to be deployed to GitHub Pages at `https://tommyngx.github.io/react101`.

Quick steps to publish:

1. Create a GitHub repo named `react101` under the `tommyngx` account.
2. Push this folder to the `main` branch of that repo.
3. On the repo, Actions will run on push and publish to Pages automatically.

Local commands:

```bash
# install deps
npm install

# dev server
npm run dev

# build for production (output in `dist`)
npm run build
```

If Actions don't run, ensure GitHub Actions are enabled for the repository.
